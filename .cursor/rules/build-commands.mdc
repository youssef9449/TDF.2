Build-commands

This rule ensures proper execution of build commands in the Windows environment.

When running build or compilation commands:

1. Never use '&&' to chain commands as this causes failures in the Windows environment
2. Always run commands separately (one at a time)
3. For building projects, use the following pattern:
   - First: `cd [ProjectDirectory]`
   - Then (as a separate command): `dotnet build`

4. For multi-step processes, break them into individual commands:
   - Use separate tool calls for each step
   - Verify completion of each step before proceeding
   - Include clear error handling for each step

5. Example of correct command usage:
   - Correct: `cd TDFMAUI` followed by a separate command `dotnet build`
   - Incorrect: `cd TDFMAUI && dotnet build`
