Documentation-context

This rule ensures all changes and implementations align with the project's core documentation.

When implementing features or fixing issues:

1. Check [TDF-Index.md](mdc:.docs/TDF-Index.md) to ensure changes follow:
   - Project structure and relationships
   - Development guidelines
   - Technical requirements
   - Documentation standards

2. Verify against [implementation-plan.md](mdc:.docs/implementation-plan.md) for:
   - Current implementation phase
   - Testing & validation requirements
   - Class relationships and SOLID principles
   - Development milestones

3. Maintain documentation consistency:
   - Update relevant sections in TDF-Index.md
   - Mark completed items in implementation-plan.md
   - Follow established directory structures
   - Adhere to defined class relationships

4. Integration with other rules:
   - Use with Progress-update for work logging
   - Use with Project-Update for documentation syncing
   - Reference core docs when implementing Working-cache items
