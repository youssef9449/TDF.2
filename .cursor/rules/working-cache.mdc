Working-cache

This rule manages the implementation planning documentation for each phase of development.

When starting a new implementation phase or making significant architectural decisions:

1. Create or update phase documentation in [working-cache.md](mdc:.docs/working-cache.md) with:
   - Phase number and name
   - Overview of goals and context
   - List of components to implement
   - Dependencies with status indicators (âœ…)
   - User stories with acceptance criteria

2. Each user story should follow the format:
   **As a** [role]
   **I want to** [action]
   **So that** [benefit]
   
   With clear acceptance criteria listed below.

3. Update dependencies section when:
   - New dependencies are identified
   - Existing dependencies are completed
   - Dependencies status changes

4. Link relevant entries from [progress.md](mdc:.docs/progress.md) to track actual implementation against the plan
