Modular Component System Implementation Plan (TDF)
Overview
This document outlines the phased approach to implementing a modular, testable, and extensible component system across the TDF suite:

TDFShared: Shared DTOs, models, helpers, and enums.
TDFAPI: CQRS-based Web API backend, business logic, and data orchestration.
TDFMAUI: Cross-platform UI using .NET MAUI, consuming API and shared logic.
Testing, validation, and debugging leverage .NET’s built-in frameworks, with a focus on maintainability and SOLID design.

Testing & Validation Approach
We’ll use a combination of automated and manual validation:

xUnit/NUnit/MSTest: Unit and integration tests for business logic, services, and controllers.
API Integration Testing: Using tools like Postman or Swagger for endpoint validation.
UI Testing: Manual and automated UI tests (e.g., .NET MAUI Test, Appium).
Debug Panels & Logging: In-app debug panels (TDFMAUI) and structured logging (Serilog, ILogger) for runtime inspection.
Mocking: Moq or similar libraries for isolating dependencies in tests.

Implementation Phases
Phase 1: Core Data Structures & Shared Library ✅
Goal: Establish DTOs, enums, models, and helpers in TDFShared.

Define DTOs for all API/UI communication.
Implement core domain models and enums.
Create helper/utility classes for common logic.
Set up custom exceptions for shared error handling.
Write unit tests for DTO validation and helpers.
Validation: All projects reference TDFShared; tests pass for DTO serialization/deserialization.

Phase 2: Backend Foundation (TDFAPI) ✅
Goal: Implement API structure, CQRS, and service layers.

Set up CQRS pattern for commands and queries.
Implement repositories and database context.
Create controllers using DTOs from TDFShared.
Add middleware for error handling and logging.
Integrate dependency injection for all services.
Implement unit and integration tests for services and controllers.
Validation: API endpoints return correct data; integration tests cover critical paths.

Phase 3: Frontend Foundation (TDFMAUI) ✅
Goal: Build cross-platform UI with modular MVVM structure.

Set up AppShell and navigation.
Implement core pages and ViewModels.
Integrate API services using DTOs from TDFShared.
Add converters, helpers, and custom controls.
Implement basic debug panel for runtime inspection.
Write unit tests for ViewModels and converters.
Validation: UI displays and manipulates data correctly; navigation and API calls work as expected.

Phase 4: Component System & Advanced Features
Goal: Modularize business logic and UI features for extensibility.

Refactor features into modular components (both backend and UI).
Implement plugin/extensibility support (e.g., MEF, reflection, or custom loader).
Add support for dynamic feature loading and configuration.
Enhance debug and logging systems for runtime diagnostics.
Expand test coverage for modular features and plugins.
Validation: New features can be added/removed without core code changes; debug/logging tools expose runtime state.

Phase 5: Integration, Optimization, and Polish
Goal: Integrate all systems, optimize performance, and refine UX.

Ensure seamless data flow between API, shared logic, and UI.
Profile and optimize critical code paths (caching, async, batching).
Implement advanced error handling and user feedback.
Polish UI/UX and add visual feedback for errors/states.
Finalize documentation and developer guides.
Validation: End-to-end tests pass; performance targets met; documentation is up-to-date.

    class Repository {
        +Get()
        +Save()

    class Controller {
        +Get()
        +Post()
    }
    class ViewModel {
        +Load()
        +Save()
    }
    class APIService {
        +CallAPI()
        +HandleResponse()
    }

SOLID Principles in Implementation
Single Responsibility: Each class/module has a clear, focused responsibility.
Open/Closed: Systems are extensible via interfaces, plugins, or configuration.
Liskov Substitution: Interfaces and base classes are used for extensibility.
Interface Segregation: Interfaces are kept small and focused.
Dependency Inversion: High-level modules depend on abstractions, not concretions.
Validation & Testing
Unit Tests: For all core logic, DTOs, and helpers.
Integration Tests: For API endpoints and data flows.
UI Tests: For critical user workflows.
Manual Validation: For complex UI or integration scenarios.
Debugging Tools: In-app debug panels, structured logging, and diagnostics endpoints.
Performance Optimization Strategies
Caching: For expensive calculations and API responses.
Async Processing: For I/O-bound and long-running operations.
Batch Processing: For bulk data operations.
Profiling: Regular use of profilers to detect bottlenecks.
Dependency Injection: For efficient resource management.
Save/Load & Persistence
Database Persistence: EF Core for backend data.
App Settings: JSON configuration for API and UI.
State Management: MVVM and DI for UI state; CQRS for backend commands/queries.
