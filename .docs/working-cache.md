# TDF Implementation Working Cache

## Phase 4: Component System & Advanced Features

### Overview
Implementation of modular business logic and UI features to enhance extensibility across the TDF application suite. This phase focuses on refactoring to support plugin architecture and dynamic feature loading.

### Goals and Context
- Create modular components for both backend and UI
- Support extensibility through plugins
- Implement dynamic feature loading
- Enhance debugging and logging capabilities
- Expand test coverage for modular components

### Components to Implement
- [ ] Modular feature framework
- [ ] Plugin loading system
- [ ] Dynamic configuration management
- [ ] Enhanced debugging tools
- [ ] Extended test infrastructure

### Dependencies
- ✅ Phase 1: Core Data Structures & Shared Library
- ✅ Phase 2: Backend Foundation (TDFAPI)
- ✅ Phase 3: Frontend Foundation (TDFMAUI)
- [ ] Component plugin architecture design

### User Stories

**As a developer**
**I want to** add new features without modifying core code
**So that** I can extend the application's functionality with minimal risk

Acceptance Criteria:
- New features can be added using a plugin interface
- Core application can discover and load plugins at runtime
- Plugins have access to necessary core services and components
- Plugin failures don't crash the application

**As an administrator**
**I want to** enable/disable features dynamically
**So that** I can control which functionality is available to users

Acceptance Criteria:
- Features can be toggled via configuration
- Changes take effect without application restart
- UI adapts to show/hide features based on configuration
- Permissions correctly integrate with feature availability

**As a support engineer**
**I want to** access enhanced debugging information
**So that** I can diagnose issues more effectively

Acceptance Criteria:
- In-app debug panel shows component state
- Logging captures component interactions
- Error states provide contextual diagnostic data
- Performance metrics are available for each component
